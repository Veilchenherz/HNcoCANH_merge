# Generate FLYA peak lists from CCPN data

### 5D: 
Use 5D.py to generate FLYA peak lists for 5D spectra from a CCPN .csv file and a .list file
### 2D/3D/4D: 
Use Flya_peaklist_generator.py to generate FLYA peak lists for 2D/3D/4D spectra from a CCPN .csv file
### Note: 
Both scripts need the headers.py file to implement the necessary xeasy headers for FLYA peak lists! To run the scripts, you need the pandas module for python
