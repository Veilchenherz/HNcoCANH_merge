# Generate FLYA peak lists (.peaks) and Reference files (.prot) from CCPNmr data

### 5D Peaklists -> (.peaks)
Use 5D.py to generate FLYA peak lists for 5D spectra from a CCPN .csv file and a .list file
### 2D/3D/4D Peaklists -> (.peaks)
Use Flya_peaklist_generator.py to generate FLYA peak lists for 2D/3D/4D spectra from a CCPN .csv file
>#### Note: 
>Both peak list scripts need the headers.py file to implement the necessary xeasy headers for FLYA peak lists! To run the scripts, you need the pandas module for python
### TALOS-N -> (.tab)
Use talos.py to generate input files from the FLYA output files. You need the flya.tab and sequence.seq files.
In addition the amino_acids.py is needed.
### Backbone torsion angles from PDB files -> (.csv)
The script torsion.pdb allows to get .csv files from the torsion angle files generated by Chimera. This makes it much easier to import the data into Excel etc.
### Reference -> (.prot)
This script allows to generate reference files (.prot) for FLYA from CCPN data. You need Poky in addition for data conversion
(see reference_prot.py for details)
