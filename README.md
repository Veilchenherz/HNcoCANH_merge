5D
  Use 5D.py to generate FLYA peak lists for 5D spectra from a CCPN .csv file and a .list file

2D/3D/4D
  Use Flya_peak_list_generator to generate FLYA peak lists for 2D/3D/4D spectra from a CCPN .csv file

Note: Both scripts need the headers file to implement the necessary xeasy headers for Flya peak lists!
